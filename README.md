# The Mandelbrot Set
The Mandelbrot Set is a set of complex numbers that create a unique fractal when graphed. Inclusion to the set is determined by the behavior of zero in the function {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}{\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}. If the magnitude always remains under the number 2, the complex number is included in the set, whereas if the magnitude reaches above 2 and continues to grow, the complex number is out of the set. 

# The function of this program
This program I created determines if a given number is in The Mandelbrot Set or outside the boundaries. The program first asks for the real and imaginary counterpart, and performs iterations of The Mandelbrot Function. One can quickly determine whether the complex number is included in the set via the output of all of the number's magnitudes.
